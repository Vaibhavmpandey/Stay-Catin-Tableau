# Stay-Catin-Tableau

### Problem Statement:-
The data presented to you is from an online platform StayCatin.com that lets
you book properties for a particular date per your requirement (similar to
Airbnb).
You have joined the firm as a business analyst and have been asked to help the
business management make smart decisions. They have provided you with the
data, which lists down details of each property listed on their website, the
reviews and how the price fluctuated with time.
You need to come up with a dashboard that helps management answer the key
questions:
1. Top 10 earners
2. Relationship between price and earnings
3. Any location (shore) getting more earnings
4. Relationship between price and reviews

Create a storyboard with the insights also.
